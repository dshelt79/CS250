# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The way I interpret user needs and implement them is to  met with a client and ask them thoroughly about what they are envisioning in the product they wish to offer to their client base.  I would also find out which of those needs are the most important and which needs are least important.  This is where the user stories come in.  From gathering the needs of the client, I can then create the user stories for these requirements and then can prioritize these user stories on the board by which are of the highest priority and which stories are of less priority.  This will help us focus on the clients bigger needs first and then focus on the least important needs last.  

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have never developed any programs in my professional career as of yet.   From taking this course, I have a better idea of the way I would go about developing now and working with teams in developing software.  I think the way I would approach developeing programs really depend on the kind of project I am working on for a client.  If I am working on a project that is simple, staightforward, and does not require frequent communication with the client, then I would use a waterfall approach.  If I happen to be working on a project that is progressive and more complex to where I think the requirements will evolve and requires communication with the client, then I would use an agile approach.  When using the agile approach, the process that I would hope to use the most would be the Daily Scrum.  Fifteen minutes of my day will save me much time further into the project should I fave any impediments.  I also think the processes of Sprint Planning, Sprint Reviews, and Sprint Retrospectives will be processes that I will need to incorporate early into my professional career, especially when working in a team environment.  

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that being a good team member requires showng up to all meetings and helping my colleagues when I can.  I also believe that being a good team member requires all of my focus and effort on the task at hand so I do not let my team members down.  When I say I will have soemthing done, I plan on backing that up with my actions.  Most important at all, being a good team member requires treating my fellow team members with profesionalism and respect.  It is like the saying goes, "Treat others how you want to be treated".
